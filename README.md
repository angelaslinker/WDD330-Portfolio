## Project 1: Simple E-commerce site for beauty products

### The first project is a simple e-commerce site for beauty products that I worked on individually. The site is primarily built with JavaScript and uses HTML and CSS for the layout and design. The site features a shopping cart and payment system, allowing customers to easily purchase products. The code is well-organized and easy to understand, making it easy to modify and expand the site in the future.

## Project 2: E-commerce site for sleeping bags

### The second project is a team project that is an e-commerce site for sleeping bags. The site is also built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The team worked collaboratively to create a visually appealing site with a seamless shopping experience for customers. The site features a variety of sleeping bags, from basic to high-end, and includes a shopping cart and payment system. The code is well-structured and organized, allowing for easy maintenance and updates.
